          <p><strong>The Owner does not warrant, endorse, guarantee, or assume responsibility for any product or service advertised or offered by a third party through the Service or any hyperlinked website or service, and the Owner shall not be a party to or in any way monitor any transaction between Users and third-party providers of products or services.</strong></p>

          <h4>Limitations of liability</h4>
          
          <p><strong>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall the Owner, and its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, directors, agents, co-branders, partners, suppliers and employees be liable for:</strong></p>
          
          <ul>
          <li><strong>any indirect, punitive, incidental, special, consequential or exemplary damages, including without limitation damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data or other intangible losses, arising out of or relating to the use of, or inability to use, the Service; and</strong></li>

          <p><strong>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, therefore the above limitations or exclusions may not apply to the User.

          <h2>Common provisions</h2>
          
          <h3>No Waiver</h3>
          
          <p>The Owner’s failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of any such right or provision.  No waiver shall be considered a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term.</p>
          
          <h3>Service interruption</h3>
          
          <p>To ensure the best possible service level, the Owner reserves the right to interrupt the Service for maintenance, system updates or any other changes, informing the Users appropriately.</p>
          
          <p>Within the limits of law, the Owner may also decide to suspend or discontinue the Service altogether. If the Service is discontinued, the Owner will cooperate with Users to enable them to withdraw Personal Data or information and will respect Users' rights relating to continued product use and/or compensation, as provided for by applicable law.</p>
          
          <p>Additionally, the Service might not be available due to reasons outside the Owner’s reasonable control, such as “force majeure” events (infrastructural breakdowns or blackouts etc.).</p>
          
          <h3>Service reselling</h3>
          
          <p>Users may not reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell or exploit any portion of this Application and of its Service without the Owner’s express prior written permission, granted either directly or through a legitimate reselling programme.</p>
          
          <h3>Privacy policy</h3>

          <h3>Intellectual property rights</h3>
          
          <p>Without prejudice to any more specific provision of these Terms, any intellectual property rights, such as copyrights, trademark rights, patent rights and design rights related to this Application are the exclusive property of the Owner or its licensors and are subject to the protection granted by applicable laws or international treaties relating to intellectual property.</p>
          
          <p>All trademarks — nominal or figurative — and all other marks, trade names, service marks, word marks, illustrations, images, or logos appearing in connection with this Application are, and remain, the exclusive property of the Owner or its licensors and are subject to the protection granted by applicable laws or international treaties related to intellectual property.</p>
          
          <h3>Changes to these Terms</h3>
          
          <p>The Owner reserves the right to amend or otherwise modify these Terms at any time. In such cases, the Owner will appropriately inform the User of these changes.</p>
          
          <p>Such changes will only affect the relationship with the User from the date communicated to Users onwards.</p>
          
          <p><strong>The continued use of the Service will signify the User’s acceptance of the revised Terms.</strong> If Users do not wish to be bound by the changes, they must stop using the Service and may terminate the Agreement.</p>
          
          <p>The applicable previous version will govern the relationship prior to the User's acceptance. The User can obtain any previous version from the Owner.</p>
          
          <h4>Exception for Consumers in France</h4>
          
          <p>Regardless of the above, any change of these Terms shall be communicated in writing no later than one month prior to becoming effective.

          <h3>Assignment of contract</h3>
          
          <p>The Owner reserves the right to transfer, assign, dispose of by novation, or subcontract any or all rights or obligations under these Terms, taking the User’s legitimate interests into account.
          Provisions regarding changes of these Terms will apply accordingly.</p>
          
          <p>Users may not assign or transfer their rights or obligations under these Terms in any way, without the written permission of the Owner.</p>
          
          <h3>Contacts</h3>
          
          <p>All communications relating to the use of this Application must be sent using the contact information stated in this document.</p>
          
          <h3>Severability</h3>
          
          <p>Should any provision of these Terms be deemed or become invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, the invalidity or unenforceability of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions, which shall remain in full force and effect.</p>
          
          <h4>US Users</h4>
          
          <p>Any such invalid or unenforceable provision will be interpreted, construed and reformed to the extent reasonably required to render it valid, enforceable and consistent with its original intent.
          These Terms constitute the entire Agreement between Users and the Owner with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersede all other communications, including but not limited to all prior agreements, between the parties with respect to such subject matter.
          These Terms will be enforced to the fullest extent permitted by law.</p>
          
          <h4>EU Users</h4>
          
          <p>Should any provision of these Terms be or be deemed void, invalid or unenforceable, the parties shall do their best to find, in an amicable way, an agreement on valid and enforceable provisions thereby substituting the void, invalid or unenforceable parts.<br>
          In case of failure to do so, the void, invalid or unenforceable provisions shall be replaced by the applicable statutory provisions, if so permitted or stated under the applicable law.</p>
          
          <p>Without prejudice to the above, the nullity, invalidity or impossibility to enforce a particular provision of these Terms shall not nullify the entire Agreement, unless the severed provisions are essential to the Agreement, or of such importance that the parties would not have entered into the contract if they had known that the provision would not be valid, or in cases where the remaining provisions would translate into an unacceptable hardship on any of the parties.</p>
          
          <h3>Governing law</h3>
          
          <p>These Terms are governed by the law of the place where the Owner is based, as disclosed in the relevant section of this document, without regard to conflict of laws principles.</p>
          
          <h4>Prevalence of national law</h4>
          
          <p>However, regardless of the above, if the law of the country that the User is located in provides for a higher applicable consumer protection standard, such higher standards shall prevail.</p>
          
          <h4>Exception for Consumers in Brazil</h4>
          
          <p>If the User qualifies as a Consumer in Brazil and the product and/or service is commercialized in Brazil, Brazilian law will apply.</p>
          
          <h3>Venue of jurisdiction</h3>
          
          <p>The exclusive competence to decide on any controversy resulting from or connected to these Terms lies with the courts of the place where the Owner is based, as displayed in the relevant section of this document.</p>
          
          <h4>Exception for Consumers in Europe</h4>
